Build a To-Do List Application:
* Create a web page with input fields to add new tasks to a to-do list.
* Implement functionality to add, edit, and delete tasks using JavaScript.
* Use localStorage to store the to-do list data so that it persists across page reloads.
  
Extend Later - Implement a Custom IMDB:
* Use a public API to fetch Movie Data from OMDB. ex.: https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=83f11fe&t='matrix'.
* Display the current movie information on the webpage using HTML and CSS.
* Add some styling to represent different genres (e.g., action, drama, horror) with appropriate icons.
